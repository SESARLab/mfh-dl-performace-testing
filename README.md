# Apache Hive and Apache Druid performance testing for MIND Foods HUB Data Lake

> Evaluating performances of enterprise Data Lake solutions for the MIND Foods HUB project

This repository contains my *Bachelor's* degree thesis work for the ["Sicurezza dei Sistemi e delle Reti Informatiche"](https://www.unimi.it/it/corsi/corsi-di-laurea/sicurezza-dei-sistemi-e-delle-reti-informatiche) course, where I discuss the performance evaluation between [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) and [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/) for the MIND Foods HUB Data Lake.

The content of the repository is the following:

- `thesis.md`: the text of my research (with the related PDF)

- `slides.pdf`: the slide that I used for the discussion

- Inside the `content` folder: are all charts and images that I drew for the thesis (using a combination of Google Sheet's charts and Miro).

- Inside the `benchmark` folder:

- - Apache JMeter test plans used to benchmark Apache Hive and Apache Druid via HTTP
  - The performance testing results in CSV
